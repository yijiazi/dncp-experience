    <t>DNCP does converge in small networks as well as larger ones. It converges fast at the cost of a quite high overall transmitted amount of data. It behaves particularly well in tree topologies as well as double tree topologies, which are the most realistic tested topologies.</t>

    <t>The first observed concern appears in the single link topology, where the amount of traffic grows dramatically with the number of nodes. The problem is known and DNCP actually proposes a solution to that problem. But this solution is optional and was not part of the tested implementation. Further attention may be necessary on these particular mechanisms in order to make sure that DNCP behaves well in such situations (if such topology is in scope of DNCP at all).</t>

    <t>The overall amount of traffic was also significant in full mesh topologies as well as string topologies. A possible approach to improve these results might be to rate-limit the amount of updates that may be made in short periods of time. Such approach would provide fast convergence after small changes and would reduce the overall amount of traffic in reaction to dramatic changes.</t>

    <t>Once again, it is important to note that DNCP is expected to be verbose in case of regular or dramatic changes. DNCP users should make sure that the network eventually stabilizes, such that DNCP can take full advantage of the Trickle algorithm.</t>

    <t>Next iterations of this document might include further results such as:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>Measures with libdncp2 instead of libdncp(v1).</t>
            <t>Measures with different profiles (rather than the HNCP profile alone).</t>
            <t>Other metrics (e.g., convergence ratio).</t>
            <t>Other scenarios (e.g., no updates at all, sporadic updates).</t>
