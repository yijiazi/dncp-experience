<section title="Conclusion" anchor="conclusion">

<t>Seen from the evaluation results, in overall, DNCP can provide topology discovery and state synchronization within a short period of time at a reasonable traffic price, it can satisfy the demands of homenet and can be applied to other networks. DNCP is obviously well suited for tree-like topologies which are closer to realistic networks, so it is logic to assume dncp to work well in reality. </t>

<t>One notable potential problem for DNCP is that the convering state may be unstable, as in the case of single link and full mash topology, there is a chance that the network can be disturbed after converging (without any node publishing new data).</t>

<t>The performance of DNCP will be degraded in dense broadcast link and in a network where the node has many interfaces, a topology like full mesh not only takes more time to converge but also consumes heavier traffic overhead.</t>

<t>Note that in the implementation used for simulation, DNCP sends a packet for every node state request and every node state reply instead of wrapping all the requests or replies together in one packet. So when the network size is large, at a certain moment a node may send tons of requests or replies, causing device buffer congestion and packets loss. With this improved in the newer version, DNCP can perform even better.</t>

<t>It is expectd that in the next version of this document:
