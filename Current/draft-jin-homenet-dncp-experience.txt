1.  Introduction

   o  DNCP is a protocol used for state synchronization.  It is
      described in [draft-ietf-homenet-dncp-03], and right now its use
      case is mostly in homenet.  DNCP provides a way for each node in
      the network to publish a set of TLV tuples, which is the data that
      it wants to share with other nodes, and valide the data received
      from other nodes by making sure the source node of the data is
      reachable.  It takes advantage of trickle algorithm to control the
      sending of the status updates, thus decrease the amount of traffic
      especially when there are no updates in the network.

   o  Since DNCP is a protocol not yet standardized, it has not been
      widely deployed, but in order for the homenet to run on it, it is
      important to evaluate its performances under various senarios
      which is not so easy to do in real life but relatively easy using
      network simulators such as ns3.  With the help of ns3, we can
      create various topologies and get logs for analyzing.  This draft
      documents our experience of implementing dncp and integrating it
      in ns3, as well as the results of performance evaluation.  We
      believe that the results obtained from the simulation are helpful
      for the implementation of dncp and can be a useful reference for
      the potential users of dncp.

   o  The document is organized as follows: First we introduce the
      current implementation of dncp in Section 2.  Then the draft
      describes simulation setup, including simulation environment, the
      metrics being evaluated and the topologies used for simulation.
      The third part documents the results of performance evaluations
      under different senarios.  And finally from all the above, we draw
      our conclusions.


2.  Implementations

   TODO list, for each known implementations (I think we have only one
   at this point?)

   o  conducted by who?

   o  open/close source? if open source, the link?

   o  if available, number of lines/foot print

   o  if available, operational experience.
