Internet-Draft               DNCP Experience                   July 2015


1.  Introduction

   o  DNCP is a protocol used for state synchronization.  It is
      described in [draft-ietf-homenet-dncp-03], and right now its use
      case is mostly in homenet.  DNCP provides a way for each node in
      the network to publish a set of TLV tuples, which is the data that
      it wants to share with other nodes, and valide the data received
      from other nodes by making sure the source node of the data is
      reachable.  It takes advantage of trickle algorithm to control the
      sending of the status updates, thus decrease the amount of traffic
      especially when there are no updates in the network.

   o  Since DNCP is a protocol not yet standardized, it has not been
      widely deployed, but in order for the homenet to run on it, it is
      important to evaluate its performances under various scenarios
      which is not so easy to do in real life but relatively easy using
      network simulators such as ns3.  With the help of ns3, we can
      create various topologies and get logs for analyzing.  This draft
      documents our experience of implementing dncp and integrating it
      in ns3, as well as the results of performance evaluation.  We
      believe that the results obtained from the simulation are helpful
      for the implementation of dncp and can be a useful reference for
      the potential users of dncp.

   o  The document is organized as follows: First we introduce the
      current implementation of dncp in Section 2.  Then the draft
      describes simulation setup, including simulation environment, the
      metrics being evaluated and the topologies used for simulation.
      The third part documents the results of performance evaluations
      under different scenarios.  And finally from all the above, we
      draw our conclusions.


2.  Implementations

   TODO list, for each known implementations (I think we have only one
   at this point?)

   o  conducted by who?

   o  open/close source? if open source, the link?

   o  if available, number of lines/foot print

   o  if available, operational experience.

3.  Simulation Setup

3.1.  Simulation Environment

   The current dncp implementation relies largely on linux library (for
   opening sockets, sending and receiving packets..etc) and uses uloop
   for scheduling events.  To integrate dncp into ns3, we have to
   redefine all the functions in the code that are related to these two
   parts so that packets can be sent and received in ns3 and events can
   be scheduled using ns3 scheduler.

   We used CSMA model in ns3 to simulate layer one and layer two.  CSMA
   model is designed in the spirit of Ethernet but different from the
   real-life Ethernet in the sense that the CSMA channel can provide
   instantaneous carrier sense and priority-based collision avoidance.
   The channel has three states: TRANSMITTING, PROPAGATING and IDLE, the
   states can be seen immediately by the devices attached to the channel
   so collision never happens.  CSMA model consists of two parts: CSMA
   channel and CSMA device.  CSMA channel is the model of the
   transmission medium, and CSMA device is like the an Ethernet device,
   the CSMA devices are connected to the channel.

   Listed below are several attributes of the CSMA device that we can
   configure:

   o  MTU:The mac level maximum transmission unit, set to 1500

   o  Encapsulation Mode: Type of link layer encapsulation to use.  In
      our simulation we use the default mode "Dix" which is commonly
      used in Ethernet.

   o  TxQueue: Type of the transmit queue used by the device.  In ns3,
      we have the possibility to choose from Codel queue, drop tail
      queue and RED (random early detection) queue.  Here we use the
      drop tail queue and set the buffer of the queue to 100 packets.
      (bytes can also be used as the maximum queue size metrics)

   o  Interframe gap: The pause between two frames

   And the attributes of the CSMA channel that we can configure:

   o  Data rate: The transmission data rate to be provided to the
      devices connected to the channel.  That is the rate of the device
      pushing data into the channel.  This attribute applies to all the
      devices on the same channel.  In the simulation we set it to
      1000Mbps thus providing an infinite throughput to eliminate the
      impact of throughput on the performance of dncp, in order to
      calculate the actual throughput comsumed.

   o  Delay: The spped-of-light propagation delay over the medium.
      Imagine there is a symmetrical hub that is of equal cable lenghth
      to all the devices of the channel.  When one device sends a packet
      to another device, the packet fist reaches the hub and is
      forwarded to the destination device, so the propagation delay is
      always the same for a given channel.  In our simulation, this
      delay is set to 1 micro second.

3.2.  Performance metric

   o  Convergence time: The time that dncp takes for the network to
      converge.

   o  Traffic consumption: The amount of traffic that dncp uses to
      converge.  To evaluate the traffic consumption we count the
      overall amount of bytes sent during the converging process as well
      as the throughput per second.

3.3.  Chosen toplogies

3.3.1.  Link topology

   All the nodes are on the same link, share the medium.

3.3.2.  String topology

   Nodes connected by point-to-point link in a line.

3.3.3.  Mesh topology

   A fully connected mesh.

3.3.4.  Tree topology

   A binary tree

3.3.5.  Double Tree topology

   Add some redundancy on the top of binary tree topology


4.  Performance Evaluation
