    The Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP) is a protocol framework providing dynamic network topology discovery and data synchronization within a network of participating nodes. At the time of writing this document, DNCP is specified in an internet draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-homenet-dncp"/> and in standardization process by the Homenet working group.

<t>
    DNCP leaves some parameters to be specified by DNCP profiles, which are actual implementable instances of DNCP. Nodes implementing the same DNCP profile, and operating within the same DNCP network, are able share TLV tuples (called Node Data), discover the network topology, and auto-detect arrival and departure of other nodes.

    This document reports experience with the main Open-Source implementation of DNCP ('libdncp', part of 'hnetd') and provides a performance evaluation of this same implementation. For the purpose of this document, an early version of libdncp has been used. A newer version has since been published. The results presented in this document only reflect performances of the older version, but will be updated in next iterations of this document. A second DNCP implementation has also been published recently, but has not been evaluated.

<t>
    DNCP was first specified for home networks, but is also applicable to other networks. The present document therefore presents DNCP performances on topologies that we might not expect in a home network. That is to evaluate the performances of DNCP in the most various situations.

    Experiments and measures were made in a simulated environment using the Network Simulator version 3 (NS3). NS3 is a discrete event simulator widely used and recognized by the scientific community.
